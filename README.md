# Data-Driven Retail Analytics and Demand Forecasting


## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing retail sales data to extract meaningful business insights and build demand forecasting models. It combines data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, SQL-based querying, and predictive modeling to support inventory management and strategic retail decision-making.


## Key Features
- End-to-end retail data analysis pipeline using Python and SQL
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for sales, customers, and product trends
- Demand forecasting models for future sales estimation
- Interactive dashboards for visualizing KPIs and performance metrics
- Business-focused insights to aid inventory and demand planning


## Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Data Analysis:** Pandas, NumPy
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
- **Database:** SQL / SQLite
- **Dashboarding:** Power BI (PBIX)
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook

## Methodology
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing of raw retail data
2. SQL-based querying for structured analysis
3. Exploratory analysis to identify trends and seasonality
4. Feature engineering for demand forecasting
5. Forecasting using statistical and machine learning approaches
6. Visualization of insights through interactive dashboards


## Results and Insights
- Identified high-performing products and seasonal demand patterns
- Highlighted customer purchasing behavior and sales trends
- Generated forecasts to support inventory optimization


## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Open `main.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook
3. Install required Python libraries
4. Run all cells to reproduce the analysis and forecasts


## Future Enhancements
